# Cannabis-usage-during-COVID-in-Canada
During the pandemic, there was an observation of increased usage of Cannabis in Canada. As the impact of the epidemic is difficult to evaluate and the retail environment is rapidly altering in various jurisdictions, with more cannabis outlets opening and more items entering to market, Statistics Canada stressed that continuous monitoring of cannabis consumption is important. The Canadian Perspective Survey Series 6 conducted in 2021 is focused on substance use and stigma during the pandemic. The survey captures all basic factors of respondents like age, house, marital status, income etc., along with series of questions with relevant options. Around 3940 people participated in the survey. With the available data, the project aims to find the frequency of consumption of cannabis during COVID-19 and  various underlying factors that contribute to the increased consumption of cannabis among individuals for which we would need a prediction model that could be useful in creating awareness and control the usage.
